# Introduction

`gypcrete` is an in-house components library from iCHEF.
It's currently split into 3 packages:

- `@ichef/gypcrete` - core components and styles
- `@ichef/gypcrete-form` - components built for form purposes
- `@ichef/gypcrete-imageeditor` - a component that allows you to scale, rotate and crop images

Here's a quick example of how you might use components from gypcrete:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@ichef/gypcrete';

const CustomComponent = () => (
  <Button basic="Hello World!" />
);

export default CustomComponent;
```
